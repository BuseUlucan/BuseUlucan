		<div class="dikdörtgen"><p>I joined the international student community called BEST at the beginning of the spring semester. I'm currently a member of the best community's content team. While in this team, I studied Photoshop and participated in workshops such as marketing, event organization and design. The video I edited in the content team was shared on the social media account. You can view the video by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/COibyumgXzz/?hl=tr" target="_blank">clicking here.</a> I attended the regional meeting called RM to experience the international side of the community. In RM, I met people from different countries, joined a lot of training and looked for solutions to environmental problems. While doing these, I made many foreign friends and got to know new cultures.</p> </div>

		<div class="dikdörtgen"><p>I love traveling, learning about new places and new cultures. In Turkey, you can learn a lot even when you move from one city to another. I had the opportunity to visit many cities in Turkey, some of which are Amasya, Nevşehir and Kastamonu. Moreover, I had the opportunity to travel abroad in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Bulgaria. I went to Bosnia and Herzegovina to help their school in high school. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country that I want to go to again after the epidemic because they are as welcome as the Turkish people. People are very friendly. Moreover, the food was also very nice, especially I liked their börek.</p></div>
